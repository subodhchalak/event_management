## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/subodhchalak/event_management.git
    cd event_management
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**

    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```sh
    # Create and activate a virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Create and activate a virtual environment (Windows)
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install required packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Apply database migrations**

    ```sh
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4.  **Create a superuser**

    To access the admin panel, you'll need a superuser account.

    ```sh
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

5.  **Run the development server**

    ```sh
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can:
*   Access the admin panel at `/admin` to create and manage events.
*   Navigate the main site to view the list of upcoming events.
*   Register as a new user to sign up for events.

## API Documentation

This project uses Swagger and ReDoc for API documentation. Once the development server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:

*   **Swagger UI:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/swagger/)
*   **ReDoc:** [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc/)

The documentation provides detailed information about all available endpoints, including request parameters, and response schemas.

## API Request Examples

Here are a few examples of how to interact with the API. Both `curl` and raw HTTP formats are provided.

### 1. List All Upcoming Events
